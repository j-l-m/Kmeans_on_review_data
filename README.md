# Kmeans_on_review_data
Part of an ecommerce course. 

(old project from 2018)
Data was originally from an Amazon product review dataset with over 80 million entries.
This data was cleaned and aggregated by user to create a listing of average user review score and average helpfulness of the user's reviews.
The aggregated data consists of roughly 21 million rows.

The elbow method was used to determine the number of clusters but is not included in the Jupyter notebook.

The default KMeans function of the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library is used here.
